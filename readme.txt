Extract Mtstores.zip inside public_html/htdocs.


Note the path/location in which you extracted the MTStores.zip file. 

After extracing this zip file, open a tab and enter into the address bar  "yoursite/public/install/welcome.php". e.g if you extracted the file inside "app" folder under public_html/htdocs ,the address you will type is "https://example.com/app/public/install/welcome.php" without quotes. and if its directly inside public_html/htdocs then address would be "https://example.com/public/install/welcome.php".

This will take you to the installation page if you carefully follow the instructions above.

Follow the instructions on the setup page. Once installation is completed, go to your cpanel and upload the sql file named mtstores.sql. Thats all. Your site should be up and running.

If you still have issues installing, contact a developer or send me email via andricon1316@gmail.com


Note: The free version does not have admin/staff mode and no support. Enjoy!!!
